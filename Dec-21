select name, ifnull(sum(distance),0) as travelled_distance from (select u.name, u.id, r.distance from users u left outer join rides r on u.id = r.user_id) as T group by name, id order by 
travelled_distance desc, name 



-- ifnull(A,0) Means if a value in column A is null - it will make it 0. Cool!
